    <p>Welcome to our study! The aim of this study is to understand how we can use technology to suggest new recipes to
        people, based on their preferences.
        This study is part of the PhD research of Ayoub El Majjodi
        at the University of Bergen, Norway, under supervision of Prof. Dr. Christoph Trattner and Dr. Alain Starke.
        <br>
        Please carefully read the procedure followed in this study to give your informed consent for voluntary
        participation*.
    </p>
    <b>Procedure</b>
    <p>
You will be first asked to answer a few questions about your personal characteristics. Then, you are asked to choose a preferred food category, and to disclose your preferences for recipes in terms of their popularity, serving size, 
cooking time and the number of ingredients.        
<br>
Based on your personal preferences, you will afterwards be presented a list of ten personalized recipe recommendations. From that list, please select one recipe that you like the most and would like to cook at home. Afterwards, you will be asked a few questions about the chosen recipe and the decision-making process.
